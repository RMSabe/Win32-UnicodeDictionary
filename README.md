# Win32-UnicodeDictionary
A Win32 application to convert a string of unicode characters into a sequence of numbers (decimal or hexadecimal).

This requires Windows MinGW64 resources to compile the source code.

Note: maximum string length is 128 unicode characters or 256 bytes.

I'm not a professional developer. I made this just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from it.
